/// Regression tests for the `maxCompletedTaskAgeDays` filter asymmetry.
///
/// **The bug.** The age cutoff was applied to the source scan (Step 1) but not
/// to the Reminders → Obsidian writeback (Step 6). With
/// `enableNewTaskWriteback = true` and a long history of completed reminders,
/// every old completion was eligible for writeback into the source vault on
/// next sync — recreating the exact symptom that #11 was filed for (and that
/// v3.3.0 only half-fixed by adding the setting).
///
/// **The fix.** Split the filter into two helpers:
///   * `SyncEngine.completedTaskCutoffDate(for:)` — compute the cutoff once
///     per sync; returns nil when the filter is disabled.
///   * `SyncEngine.isCompletedTaskTooOld(_:cutoff:)` — pure comparison.
/// Both the source scan (Step 1) and the writeback loop (Step 6) call the
/// pair. In the writeback loop the age filter runs AFTER the v5.8.2 title-
/// dedup so the dedup's `syncState.addOrUpdateMapping(...)` side-effect is
/// preserved for old reminders whose titles match an existing vault task.
///
/// The tests split into two groups: pure helper unit tests at the top, then
/// integration tests at the bottom that drive `SyncEngine.performSync(...)`
/// with mock `TaskSource` / `TaskDestination` so the writeback site itself is
/// exercised — without these, a future refactor that inverts or removes the
/// `if` at the writeback call site would pass the unit tests but reintroduce
/// the bug.
